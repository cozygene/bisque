\title{Transforms bulk expression of a gene given overlapping data}
\usage{
SupervisedTransformBulk(gene, Y.train, X.train, X.pred)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene}{Character string. Gene name that corresponds to row in Y.train}

\item{Y.train}{Numeric Matrix. Number of gene rows by number of overlapping
individuals columns. Contains weighted sum of reference profile by
single-cell based cell proportion estimates for each individual}

\item{X.train}{Numeric Matrix. Number of gene rows by number of overlapping
individuals columns. Contains observed bulk expression for each individual}

\item{X.pred}{Numeric Matrix. Number of gene rows by number of remaining
individuals columns. Contains observed bulk expression for each individual
to be transformed.}
}
\value{
Y.pred Numeric Matrix. One row for given gene by number of remaining
  individuals columns. Contains transformed bulk expression for each
  individual.
}
\description{
For a specific gene, this function uses linear regression to learn a
transformation of the bulk expression to match the values produced
by the single-cell based reference and observed single-cell based cell
proportions.
}
\details{
If a linear transformation cannot be learned for a gene (zero variance in
observed bulk or single-cell based weighted sums), a vector of NaNs will
be returned of the expected length (length of X.pred)
}
